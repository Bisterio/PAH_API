# PAH_API
This is a clone repository for Platform for Antique and Handicraft Exchange (a.k.a PAH), which is a graduate thesis topic of me and my teammates.

The PAH project's purpose is to build a platform providing services for buying, selling, and auctioning antiques and handicrafts.

The original repository is here: https://github.com/Baro1509/PAH_API.git
